## Functionality

### Frontend (inside the "client" directory):

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products within the application.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart for future purchase.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can access an admin panel for managing products, orders, and other site content.
- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and access personalized features.

### Backend (inside the "server" directory):

- **API Endpoints**: The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication, including retrieving product information, user profiles, order processing, and more.
- **Database Interaction**:
  - **Database Setup**: We connect to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data, with defined schemas and models for structured data storage.
  - **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data in the database, including adding products, updating user profiles, processing orders, and more.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**:
  - We've implemented user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access specific parts of the application. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication.
- **Middleware**: Middleware functions handle common tasks like request parsing, error handling, and logging.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is in place to provide informative error messages to the frontend, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **File Uploads**: A secure and efficient file upload mechanism is implemented for features like product image uploads.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Third-party services and APIs are integrated for features such as payment processing, email notifications, and social media sharing.
  explains how the frontend should interact with the backend.

- **Scalability**: Strategies are considered to ensure the scalability of the backend.

## Upcoming Features

We're actively working on enhancing Trend Tribe with new features to provide a better shopping experience. Here are some of the upcoming features that we're excited to bring to the project:

- **Checkout**: We're developing a seamless and secure checkout process to make it easy for users to purchase products. The checkout feature will include options for payment, shipping, and order confirmation.

- **Separate Category Page**: We're creating a dedicated category page to help users easily browse and discover products based on their interests. This will make it even more convenient for users to find the products they're looking for.
